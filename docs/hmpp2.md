# Haptic Motifs Progress Post 2

After the last two months of reading papers and thinking about unconventional and tangible input devices for virtual environments, I’m getting a sense of some interesting directions to follow in my own project. Here are a few!

1. Less story-oriented: A headband or belt that could use vibrations or other tactile feedback to direct user attention. Would be interesting to replicate studies that use auditory modality for cues.
2. More story-oriented: Vibration feedback from handheld controllers that gives more narrative information about a certain angle of the scene. For example, a “lie detector” in a mystery story.
3. Tactile input that gives the user the ability to slow down the scene, maybe in limited quantities. Intentionally play with the idea of FOMO and overstimulation.
4. Tactile input that gives the user the ability to improve the image quality of the scene, or apply various image processing to the video
5. No visual feedback, only audio and tactile feedback. “Feel out” the scene around you
6. Controller involves some sort of costume or prop from the world of the story– just knowing its real-world form could have an impact
7. Controller incorporates shoulders, ankles, neck, etc.: not handheld, maybe requires more expressive or unusual gestures
8. Building off expressive or unusual gestures: could be interesting to need to observe the actions of a character in the video to learn the gestures or learn how to use the controllers. Game-inspired onboarding?
9. Controllers that “split” the story in the video into different branches. (Note: I’m not as excited about the idea of changing the story as I am about hiding information in the story in different modalities.)
10. Tactile feedback to warn the user about story events? Suspense/foreshadowing/anticipation, could result in better attention to the scene and more awareness of when to search the scene vs. keep paying attention to primary point of interest.
