*September 11, 2019: General review of readings and 360 video.*

The last two weeks mark the beginning of my research phase. I’ve been searching for examples of the best work currently being done in the space of 360* video. What does the current landscape look like? What work is being done in controller development (especially weird controller development?) What about storytelling development?

Notes and more detailled reviews of various readings/videos can be found here. This post is meant to summarize and write up general thoughts/questions/conclusions.

# Controller Design

## Traditional 360* Controller Design

In my research, I wasn’t able to find any examples of a controller specifically designed for watching 360* video. VR/360* controllers are generally designed to function for many purposes, and are heavily inspired by gaming controllers. They tend to be handheld, ergonomic and sleek. Their visual appearance is very understated.

I found a fantastic article about how Oculus designed their Rift controllers. When developing the controllers, they spent a lot of time thinking about “hand presence” and making the user feel like their hands in particular were involved in the virtual world. Presence is a nebulous and subjective concept, so I’m interested in focusing on “hand presence” as a subset of overall presence and looking at factors that affect this. I was also interested in Oculus’ thoughts on how their controllers affected social presence in VR.

## Alternative Design Inspiration

From bizarre LBEs (VR experiences in a specific real-world place) to biofeedback that incorporates the rhythms of your body into the VR environment, there is a lot of exciting work being done in the space of alternative controller design for VR/360*. In contrast to mainstream controllers, alt controller design in this space is highly focused on specific applications. I’ve found a few standout designs explicitly for improving storytelling in VR, such as the SwiVR Chair, which rotates the user through a scene to create interesting shots without inducing simulator sickness, or this Canadian VR/theater piece which uses extensive motion capture to let the audience interact with objects in the space and has an actress hold the audience’s hand. However, there’s inspiration to be drawn from even controllers designed with no storytelling applications in mind. I skimmed through the VR sections of two alternative controller blogs and noticed that I’m drawn to controllers that incorporate social interaction in strange ways (such as this backpack), controllers with a distinctive real-world audiovisual presence (such as this Minecraft experience), and controllers that involve removing the headset (such as this game.) Who knows if I’ll go in any of these directions with my own project, but they’re interesting to explore!

# Storytelling in 360*
## Directing Strategies

I also did some reading this week focusing on cinematography strategies for VR/360* content. The most helpful resource was an article published by Oculus’ Story Studio several years ago, about the directing strategy for their piece Lost. The team described the ways they distinguish their approach when directing a 360* piece from a traditional directing mindset. In particular, they chose to think of the story in terms of its “density”, both spatially and temporally: what portion of the 360* available degrees is being taken up with story events at any given time? How quickly are these events happening? Rather than think in a linear sequence of actions, the team thought in terms of story “moments” of general activity. They also addressed onboarding, which is a constraint unique to VR/360* storytelling, and transitioning the audience into the virtual world.

This is the most concrete resource I’ve found on directing in this space. I would like to push further into the Oculus suggestions and start thinking about ways to make them more quantitative. Can we compare story density between two different videos and see how that affects other factors?

# Next Steps

* Next progress post (roughly two weeks out): I’m going to make a very short narrative piece using the Gear 360*, to become more comfortable with the production/editing workflow of 360* video!
* Progress post #3 (roughly a month out):
* Watch some well-reviewed 360* videos and potentially make an infographic comparing different qualities about them (ex. story density?)
* Meet with local professionals in this field to discuss their workflows
* Look into more academic examples of alternative controller design and the concept of “hand presence”.
