How can 360* video become more engaging to audiences through the use of nonconventional or alternative controller devices? During the 19-20 academic year, I created an independent research project for myself to explore the artistic, technical, and user experience aspects of this question. This is the most interdisciplinary project that I've ever worked on, and I found myself immersed in a crazy array of subjects: from interactive narrative design, to spatial audio production, to alternative controller fabrication, to 360* video cinematography, to browser-based VR coding, all the way to UX research.
