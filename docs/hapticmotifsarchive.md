**How can 360 video become more engaging to audiences through the use of nonconventional or alternative controller devices?**

During the 19-20 academic year, I created an independent research project for myself to explore the artistic, technical, and user experience aspects of this question. This archive holds the results!

This project was funded by a Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) grant for the 2019-2020 academic year and additionally received the Savit Scholarship from the same program as an outstanding interdisciplinary proposal. UROP makes it possible for undergraduate students from all colleges at CU Boulder to lead independent research projects. The generous support of UROP, the Savit family, and the ATLAS Institute THING Lab is highly appreciated.
