      We live in such an amazing time. Information is ubiquitous and <a href ="hypertext-9.html">limitless</a> and <a href ="hypertext-3.html">  intoxicating</a>. I am a god: I can sink into flawless virtual reality, stream vast playlists of music, craft seamless vector art. My thumbs are strong as oxen.
      I can indulge in trendy <a href ="hypertext-1.html">analog</a> technologies, picking and choosing the most aesthetic vestiges of each generation: writing calligraphy with flex nibs, playing on a grand piano, snapping Polaroids. Any possible <a href ="hypertext-8.html">  version</a> of myself that I contrive is given legitimacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am unconstrained by form.
