      I love that I live in a world where I can buy woodcut posters online—so <a href ="hypertext-2.html">authentic</a> yet so modern!—and they’ll arrive within the week. Imagine that, less than a week between hot fresh ink seeping into a piece of paper in Portland and a cool, smooth poster all rolled up in a cardboard tube dropping onto my doorstep in Boulder! Like magic. Email, clothing, pizza appears out of thin air. All I have to do is <a href ="hypertext-6.html"> click</a> a few buttons, and centuries compress. <br> Near instant gratification, and it just keeps getting more and more <a href ="hypertext-4.html">instant.</a>
