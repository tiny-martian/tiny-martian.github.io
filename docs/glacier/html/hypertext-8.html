      Will I really be <a href ="hypertext-5.html">happy</a> in the end? When I have all the universeâ€™s information at my metal fingertips, what will I do with it that could <a href ="hypertext-9.html">matter</a> more than driving my own car through the mountains when the aspens are just starting to glimmer gold?
