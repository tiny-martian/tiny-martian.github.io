      Some of the nostalgic stories I tell my children will be about going to the grocery store when I was their age. The harsh white light <a href ="hypertext-7.html">illuminating</a> me as I wandered, dazed, through aisle after aisle of peanut butter, cookies, canned soup. Nestled beside bags of frozen ravioli and bottles of salad dressing, I would sit in the basket of the cart and pretend I was <a href ="hypertext-8.html">driving</a> a car. (As if human-driven cars will be any more relatable!)
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ll remember my mom's unparalleled talent to <a href ="hypertext-6.html">identify</a> the ripeness of any produce, knocking on watermelons and peeling back the papery leaves of corn to check for worms and silk, divining fortunes in the freckles of pears.

      I’ll tell them about how, in the butcher’s section, there was a tank of lobsters on the counter, level with my line of sight from the cart. I would smush my nose right against the tank and watch their antenna sway in the briny water. They huddled against the sides, claws incapacitated with thick rubber bands, staring out across the aisle at the purple mass of cabbage upon cabbage, heaped in a bin like heads of slaughtered enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grocery store, <a href ="hypertext-3.html">heavenly</a> and savage. I’ll tell my kids wistfully about the smooth linoleum floors, coffee grounds and flower leaves trodden into them, as I hurry outside to unload a drone with our marshmallows and chicken nuggets for the night.
