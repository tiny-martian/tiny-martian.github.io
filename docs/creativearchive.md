*Stories written in a creative writing class I took in Chile!*

1. ["Amarga"](./creativewriting/amarga.md)
2. ["La Perla"](./creativewriting/laperla.md) *For this assignment, I was instructed to find the equivalent location described in a historical passage about Valparaíso and write my own description. The location: a forge. The result: a memorable and eventually delightful afternoon of hunting down a modern-day forge in one of Valpo's sketchiest neighborhoods.*
