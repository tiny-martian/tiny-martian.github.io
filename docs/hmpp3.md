# Haptic Motifs Progress Post 3

*November 8, 2019: Proposal Rough Draft and General Updates*

## But first, some general project updates:

* I’m going to ICIDS! The International Conference for Interactive Digital Storytelling is taking place at Snowbird, Utah in two weeks. As if that isn’t enough of a sign, the very first workshop is about designing narrative engagement in cinematic VR. I’m so excited to go to this conference and meet academics and professionals working in this space.
* I made half a dance video! This is demo footage that I shot with a friend to test out the capabilities of the Gear 360 and the editing workflow. I was hoping to set this to music and do a cleaner edit, but several important shots didn’t work out and I don’t have quite enough content to make the video I was originally envisioning. Maybe I’ll go back to Safeway and finish the job over break.

## Story Proposal: Rough Draft

You’re in the middle of a tense house party. It’s in the early 2020’s, and recording and streaming personal events live in 360-degree video has become a big social media trend. The hostess is trying to capture the moment, and her guests aren’t all happy about it. Strangely, as you look around the room, you realize that you can hear the thoughts of some of the guests… and then the room goes dark…

### Plot and Themes

I want to tell a story about college students navigating digital privacy and permanence, within the context of a supernatural event at a party. The story will start with the hostess turning on the camera and carrying it into the center of the party to set it up (giving the viewer time to orient themselves within the scene.) The camera will go unnoticed for a minute or two as the party flows around it. Then, a guest will notice the camera, and tensions will rise. Guests and the hostess will converge around the camera, arguing about it, and then their conversation will be interrupted by a power outage and the appearance of bizarre, inexplicable visual/sound effects. The presence of the camera will continue to play a role as the guests try to figure out what to do.

There are a lot of interesting social dynamics that come to mind when I imagine teenagers and young adults streaming their parties/events live in virtual reality for others to watch. What should be shared? What makes sharing a certain moment inclusive, or vain, or exclusive, or pointless? When does sharing detract from the experience and when does it add to it?

### Desired Viewer Experience

The person viewing this video will be placed in the role of an external friend or peer, watching the party as it streams. At the same time, they’ll have the ability to discover and experience story details and content that an external person streaming the event would never have: they can hear the thoughts of partygoers who walk close enough to the camera.

Cinematic VR and 360* video is a “lean-in” media experience (Vosmeer and Schouten), with related design challenges. Viewers generally expect more interaction and engagement here than when watching traditional “lean-back” video content. On the other end of the spectrum, more game-like experiences with objectives can involve more “lean-forward” active decision-making than viewers particularly want (Ana Rita Jesus Costa.) I believe that a way to balance those demands is to add an additional hidden layer of narrative content to the story that viewers can explore and discover, but don’t need to in order to enjoy the experience.

My proposed mechanic for story discovery attempts to provide interesting viewer decisions that have no effect on the development of the story. When characters get within “thought range” of the camera, the viewer will be alerted by cues indicating their locations. They can then choose to turn towards those characters, and take some action (such as pressing a button) to listen to their thoughts. However, they can also choose to not listen to any thoughts and just continue to observe the full scene. Character thoughts will not contain any highly critical information to the plot, but rather provide emotional richness and context to the events of the video.

### User Research Questions
* Can tactile feedback be an effective way to indicate multiple RoIs (points of interest) in a scene? Rothe, Buschek, Hubmann discuss the challenges of designing attention guiding techniques to alert viewers to multiple RoIs. It’s challenging to design cues for these situations that are effective, subtle, and not overwhelming. I would like to design or modify a controller that can convey 360* of information through vibrations or other tangible feedback, and test its effectiveness for guiding attention and its effects on presence within the scene.
* Can implementing a “story overlay” of information in CVR provide a satisfying “lean-in” viewer experience that is engaging while still fundamentally passive? (See “Desired Viewer Experience”).

### Next Steps:
* Screenwriting
* Blocking: how can characters be arranged and moved around the camera in a way that is conducive to testing question #1 and results in interesting viewing decisions?
* Re-write user testing proposal to be more relevant to my current proposal and re-submit it to the IRB
* Controller design and hardware decisions
* What people do I need to reach out to in order to get all of this made by late March?
