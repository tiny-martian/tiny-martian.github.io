# Here there be Dragons

On February 20, I woke up over a completely blank page.

It took a minute to realize it couldn’t be anything other than the Atacama Desert, pale and fascinating and vast through the window of the plane. Aquí hay dragones. My last glimpse of land had been in Texas, and then suddenly I was hovering over South America. It felt so, so surreal as the plane dropped into the Andes and the landscape morphed: from endless desert, to a floor of clouds with rusty peaks stabbing through like teeth, to arid yellow hills and then the green of vineyards. It’s been four weeks since I landed, but I haven’t been able to shake that feeling of floating in an undefined space.

…Luckily for my academic record, it does happen to be a defined space. I’m so fortunate to have the chance to be spending this (spring? fall?) semester at the Universidad Pontifica Catolica de Valparaiso, Chile. Until July, I’ll be here living alongside the Pacific Ocean, taking classes in Spanish and rooming with a local family. This trip is my first visit to the Southern Hemisphere. It’s also my first real full-immersion experience, and the longest period of time I’ll have ever spent away from my hometown.

I’ve wanted to do this ever since I walked into my first Spanish classes in seventh grade. A decade later, after countless hours of learning grammar and watching telenovelas, watching study abroad office presentations starry-eyed and rearranging my degree plan over and over again, applying for a student visa and buying tickets and optimizing duffels in a last-minute panic, I’m finally making it happen.

It’s been wonderful so far, but it hasn’t been easy. It absolutely hasn’t been dignified. Still, despite the embarrassment and frustration and loneliness, it’s so incredible to me that only one month ago, Chile was just a word.

Now it’s a place, and with every day it becomes more.
