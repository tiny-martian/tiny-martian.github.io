# Trash Canyon

“Are you two lost?” the girl asks in English with a grin. Her hair is tied up into a chaotic, gravity-defying clump of a bun. She’s wearing a ratty tee and old hiking boots with big, fuzzy socks rolled down around her ankles.

It’s become clear to my friend Annie and I that our fun, easy day trip has some holes in it. We had heard about a beautiful reservoir near Santiago, the capital— supposedly a great place to disconnect from city life. Funnily enough, after a 5:00 AM wakeup, a long bus ride from Valparaíso, two metro lines, and a crowded microbus up to a remote Andean village, we learned that the reservoir was still seventy kilometers away and only accessible by car.

However, the next unpredictable turn of the day came in the form of a grungy fairy godmother. Halfway through a futile argument with a bus driver, Javi jumped off of the bus and offered to take us under her wing. She’s a bilingual engineering student who grew up in the area, here to visit a friend and camp at a local trail system. We explain our predicament, and she immediately invites us along. Even though we don’t know very much about what this new plan entails, the fact that Javi has any kind of relevant knowledge is highly alluring. Especially relevant knowledge that doesn’t involve more public transport.

Soon enough, Annie and I are walking awkwardly with Javi and her friend Ricardo as they stroll casually along an empty dirt road in the middle of absolutely nowhere. The two Chileans are gorgeous, tan hippies with holes in everything they have on and early afternoon sunlight glowing in their glossy, tangled hair. Behind them, we’re glowing with sunscreen, wearing our specialty hiking clothes, and looking around anxiously at the bone-dry hills, trying to spot a recognizable trail.

We stop in front of a barbed-wire fence, and Javi and Ricardo share a semi-intelligible exchange stuffed full of Chilean slang. She turns to us, laughing. “How wild are you?” A minute later, we’re maneuvering ourselves through the vengeful threads of the fence. Two minutes later, we’re standing at the base of a gigantic hill and watching Javi and her friend set off up it. There are plenty of footprints in the dirt around us, but no other people… or trails.

We follow them up the steep side of the hill, sweating and trying to memorize our path as we go. I’m increasingly skeptical with every step, but when we get to the top of the ridge, it suddenly all makes sense. Up until now, our day has consisted of blues and browns: pale sky, tall, dry mountains, dusty cactus and shriveled shrubs. Now, the other colors all appear in a supersaturated secret vein of sheer nature and pure consumerism.

Trash Canyon (no idea on its actual name) is a perfectly clear stream of precious water trickling through the inhospitable mountains. It would be an oasis, if it wasn’t also home to every imaginable form of garbage. As we descend and cross the stream, I’m fascinated and disgusted by the plastic bubbling from the ground and swaying from the trees like shiny, colorful moss. It feels almost like walking through an archaeological site, populated with banana peels and crumpled beer cans instead of ancient ruins. Did we just miss some niche music festival?

We continue up and over another hill. Annie and I are getting tired, but don’t want to get separated from Javi. At least she keeps it interesting. Trotting around switchbacks on the steep trail with ease, she and her friend are having fun spinning us wild stories about Chilean society, ranging from undergraduate engineering degrees that take nine years to finish, to assassinations of water rights activists, to Argentinian prison slang (brijido: intense, horrible!) I don’t know if I believe her entirely, but some of the impassioned graffiti I see on my walk to school every day is starting to make more sense.

Finally, our group descends again towards a beautiful waterfall, spilling into a clear green pool (also featuring trash.) Here, we begin to see dingy tents glowing in grimy neon along the bank. As we approach, an entirely naked man walks in and out of view, carrying his backpack and accompanied by a dog. Anna and I exchange glances.

It’s a huge relief when we stop at one of the tents in the “campground”. Two girls are sitting under a blanket outside it, cuddling and eating peaches, with similar grungy and unthreatening vibes. The four Chileans greet each other happily, and we all sit down to drink some water and relax for a moment before heading to the stream.

Then Javi looks at me like she’s unsure of how to approach something. “Do you like, ah, mushrooms?” she asks.

I briefly contemplate the prospect of eating Trash Canyon produce and find it unappealing. “Um…”

She casts a glance at Ricardo for help. “That’s what you call it, right?” He pulls a plastic bag out of his pocket to demonstrate.

Silly me.

We politely decline. The Chileans laugh at us, but don’t seem to mind. We all walk over to the riverbank, and Annie and I sit quietly on the side while Javi and Ricardo get high, strip, and wade in. The other girls start journaling. Two pools away from us, a disgruntled camper glares over at our group and retreats into his tent.

There’s a very delicate peace in this moment: at least an hour’s hike away from civilization, hanging out with these friendly strangers as they do shrooms in their glimmering secret paradise of green and garbage.

I’m reminded of how quickly it could potentially go south when a wasp stings me between my toes in an intense, focused spike of pain. By the time I’m done hopping around on one foot and swearing, Annie quietly mentions to me that she thinks we should go. She’s right— we have another five hours of travel back to Valpo ahead of us tonight. But when we finish putting our shoes on and go over to thank Javi, she’s busy throwing up into the river and doesn’t respond.

So we find our way back to the main road, buy some Gatorade from a nearby stand, and get back on the bus.
