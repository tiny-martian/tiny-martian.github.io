#La Parcela

We’re going to spend the day at the parcela! Five of us are piled into the car: Camila, of the whole-grain bread and cigarettes and oil paintings and fierce love. Aidan, eighteen, with glorious dark hair and a ukelele. Isidora, fourteen, with beautiful sleepy eyes. Carlos, nine, who insisted that I bring my jigsaw puzzle.

And finally, their resident gringa, trying to figure out what the parcela even is.

These four are the majority of the Chilean host family who I’m spending the semester with. I moved into their house the night before, and was immediately overwhelmed by greetings: unexpected kisses on the cheek, the most confusing game of Uno that I’ve ever played, towering hot dogs slathered in avocado and condiments. I felt a thrill of excitement as I lay in bed after dinner, listening to my new family chatter downstairs and looking out of my window at a cascade of orange streetlights spilling down into the dark ocean.

Now, before I can get a better view of the city, we’re leaving it. Stocked up with massive bottles of soda and candy bars mysteriously labeled Super-8, we’re driving further and further into the sun-baked Andes. Sitting silently in the backseat, I try to follow the various conversations being thrown back and forth. Words dissolve into waves of unintelligible sound, slowly filling the car and forcing out the air.

I’m thoroughly lost by the time we arrive at the parcela, which turns out to be a ranch house. There’s a small pool, and an incredible view of the mountains all around us. Massive cactus grow on the slopes, and a tattered Chilean flag flaps above us. Camila’s partner’s parents live here, and she begins chatting with them and preparing lunch while everyone else runs towards the pool.

It feels very wrong to be exposing my winter body to the desert sun, to be submerging myself in this alien blue world. Aidan and Carlos swim smoothly, inventing games and joking. I cling to the wall and try to laugh along with things I don’t understand. Little lagartas (lizards) and avispas (wasps) crawl on the side. Drying off afterward, I see a fountain of flames shoot up from Camila’s frying pan almost to the ceiling, almost as fast and hot as the curses that fly out of her mouth.

There’s a dead rat in the roof, its tail crooked into a postmortem grappling hook. We all watch in disgust and fascination as Aidan maneuvers it free, fur showering down on him.

Lunch, twenty minutes later: couscous, wine, fried fish, and that incomprehensible flood of noise again.

Next, we’re sent to go look for a tortoise somewhere on the property. Isidora and Carlos are inexplicably terrified of it, and so I’m given a stick and sent ahead of them. I stand there, alone, poking shrubbery in hopes of revealing a potentially monstrous reptile which I’m becoming increasingly sure was a way to get us away from the adults’ conversation.

The puzzle is my salvation. It’s a panorama of rainbow buffalo that I brought from home with pieces cut into beautiful shapes: eagles in flight, howling wolves, ballerinas. It means an hour and a half of calm and focused collaboration with minimal speaking. Victorious, we delight at the clatter of pouring our hard work back into the box and jump in the pool again. I give Carlos dolphin rides around the deep end that will tweak my neck for the rest of the week, and even honestly laugh a few times.

Finally, as I’m resting on the lawn and watching the sunset, Aidan comes over to join me. Realizing that we have similar levels of second language competence, we relax into a mix of English and Spanish. It feels so good to have a personality beyond that of an exchange student.

“I think you’re going to like it here in Chile,” he says.

“I already do,” I think I tell him.
