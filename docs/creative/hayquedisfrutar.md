# Hay que Disfrutar

The kid sharing the back of the pickup truck with me is staring into my eyes with an intensity that would be uncomfortable if she was anyone but a nine-year-old girl.

As is, this is some of the most harmlessly strange hitchhiking I’ve ever done. I just finished a long hike almost an hour away from Pucón, the town where I’m staying, and would have had to sit by the road waiting for my bus for an hour if I hadn’t accepted a ride from this family. Every time we hit a bump in the road, the driver’s daughter and I are thrown into each other and scramble to reset ourselves in the truck bed. The sun is setting over the panorama of volcanoes and forest around us.

This is my first long-distance trip in Chile, as well as my first solo trip here. Within an hour of disembarking from my overnight bus in the morning, I was on my way to a remote nature preserve with nothing but my backpack, a map, and a free bus juice box.

The hike was steep and long and beautiful. I walked with my camera slung under one arm and took shots of cathedrals of mossy trees catching the light, a tarantula methodically crossing the trail with fuzzy little steps, a woodpecker poised halfway into his percussive meal. Occasionally other extranjero (foreigner) hikers passed me, but for kilometers at a time I was alone. I ate wild blackberries and not-so-wild granola bars as I walked.

From the top of the mountain, I could see four different volcanoes with white plumes of steam bright against the sky. A pair of condors wheeled above me and the forest of swaying araucania trees (think: a cross between cacti and conifers, with strange scale-like needles covering their branches.) It felt so comfortable and peaceful to be there. I had imagined this semester to be more like this: dramatic and tangible adventures, the new and remarkably unusual. Conquering the everyday was turning out to be farther outside my comfort zone.

The little girl keeps watching me. Her eyes are curious and kind. She’s asking me about myself now, and I fumble through telling her about how I decided to spend half a year in her part of the planet.

“Do you miss home?” she asks me.

“I do.” It comes out with more weight than I thought it would. “But I love being here. I love seeing things like this.”

“Claro!” She smiles, gaze still locked with mine. “Hay que disfrutar todo que puedes en este mundo (you need to enjoy everything that you can in this world.)” It should have been a lighter thing to say.

The truck stops with one final jolt, and I’m dropped off on the main street of Pucón. I can see her face still watching me from the back as it drives away through the gentle evening light and disappears around a corner.

Nothing to do but shrug and go find dinner. The rest of the weekend passes in a blink— hiking up to waterfalls and sliding down volcanoes, cooking with friends, negotiating my journey back— and then I’m thrown into another week.

Every day forward.
