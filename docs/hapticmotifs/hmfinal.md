# Haptic Motifs: Final Reflections

Wow... more than a year after beginning this project, it feels great to see all of the work I've done in this archive! 
During the time that I've worked on Haptic Motifs, I've researched a huge array of skills and disciplines.
From the right microphones to use for recording spatial audio, to the process Oculus went into when designing their controllers and their concept of hand presence, to the techniques often remniscent of sci-fi that creators can use to direct a viewer's attention around a 360 video, I've learned about some fascinating and detail-rich aspects of implementing great VR experiences that I never would have thought about before.
I've sweated over formatting scripts for interactive films, hunting down documentation from obscure Javascript functions, and uploading video from a certain 360 camera that really wanted to keep it for itself.
Thousands of words from progress blog updates and half of a script, stacks of academic papers, one week-long field trip, ten vibrating motors on a Velcro band, and many pivots later... I can look back on this project and all its ups and downs with pride.

To finish up this project, here are ten conclusions related to my research, and five personal conclusions about this project.
