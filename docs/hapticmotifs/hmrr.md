## Review of Academic Papers

### Storytelling for VR: A Study on Audience Needs and Expectations (Ana Rita Jesus Costa)
Portuguese study (70 participants)

Survey of how participants watch movies, what platforms they watch 360* content on, what genres they enjoy, what their general positive and negative associations are

Positive: FOV, exploration, immersion/involvement, realism, novelty

Negative: Image/sound quality, accessibility to the format, lack of guidance (especially: lack of interaction/narrative purpose), fear of embarrassment while wearing HMD, FOMO

Do active decisions defeat the purpose of watching a movie?

Overview: High-level study of narrative design needs and screenwriting challenges in 360*. Good to remember that users aren’t necessarily looking for strong interactivity. How to preserve voyeurism, relaxation, escapism while also making viewing experience more active?

###Directing for Cinematic VR (John Mateer)
CVR: Immersive linear experience (no interaction), OR branching paths, OR multimedia overlay onto content

“Watching a video of a play”– think Munsterberg. How to evolve artistically?

Film concept of ‘suspension of disbelief’ ties into VR concept of ‘presence’, referred to by Mateer as ‘transportation theory’

Overview: High-level discussion of traditional theory as it pertains to a new viewership balance between “being and doing”. No specific discussion of technique.

###Interactive Cinema: Engagement and Interaction (Vosmeer and Schouten)
Various methods of implementing interactive storytelling: branching, adaptive, enactive.

Distinction between using a game engine and pre-recording content as two modes of 360* production. Why not both?

“Lean-forward” content naturally a good fit for “epic” (action) and “epistemic” (mystery)-based plots. Goal: design strategies that favor “dramatic” (social) plots. (Marie-Laure Ryan)

“Both physical devices and narrative techniques may be applied to heighten this engagement”

Overview: This paper proposes using the term “lean-in media” to describe 360* content, as it blurs the boundaries between “lean-back” (cinematic, dramatic argument developed through words and images) and “lean-forward” (game, dramatic argument developed through experience of processes) content. It was published in 2014, so I would be curious to find out whether the group went forward to create any 360* work of their own.

### 5 Lessons Learned while Making Lost (Oculus Story Studio Blog)
Plan and storyboard by thinking about moments and general scenes, rather than super-specific actions and “shots”

Let the audience get used to the environment before starting the storytelling

Don’t force the user to look somewhere… at least, until after they’ve settled in

Goldilocks the “spatial” density of the scene. Not too much happening all around the user, not too little.

Simplify scope (specific to rendering in VR, but still generally true.)

Overview: This blog post from the directors of Oculus Story Studio’s piece Lost breaks down their different cinematographic and storyboarding strategies. In particular, the team re-structured their way of thinking about the “information density” of the piece, in terms of both space and time.

### SwiVRChair (Jan Gugenheimer et al.)
How to control user attention without cuts or tracking shots (simulator sickness prevents these)

“we do not try to fully control the user’s view but consider it more as a nudging and immersing of the user into the scene”

Hide information from user

Block and rotate (of chair) as two “narrative vectors”, use as building blocks in story development just like cuts. Do these scale, or would they just become gimmicky?

Overview: This team built a motorized swivel chair that can gently rotate a user through a 360* scene, or prevent them from rotating. The goal was to develop a ways to guide user attention through the scene to contribute to the narrative and hopefully avoid simulator sickness.

### Inside Oculus’ Quest to Design an Invisible VR Controller (Peter Rubin, Wired)
Controllers that are “in effect, your hands”. “On its own, Oculus’ Rift could enable presence, but the illusion felt incomplete; while the Rift could teleport you into another world, your hands didn’t make the trip”

Concept of “hand presence”— feeling that your hand and your virtual hand are one cohesive presence

Trackable in space, allow user to make hand movements without letting go of the device

Interpersonal: “Toybox” demo is first Oculus experience with social presence

Important to maintain tactile interaction, not just track hands with headset

Overview: This article breaks down the design and manufacturing process behind Oculus’ Touch controllers. I love the description of “hand presence”.

### Measuring Presence in Virtual Environments: A Presence Questionnaire (Witmer and Singer)
Experiencing virtual environment (VE) as true environment: user is no longer “separate” from computer, but within computer-generated world

The intensity of the users’ attention on the VE (involvement) will have a significant impact on their involvement/presence in the environment

Novelty will attract attention at first, but it needs to be backed up by consistency and content

Control Factors, Sensory Factors, Distraction Factors, Realism Factors– affect involvement, immersion, or both

Better presence results in better learning and performance

Overview: This paper, published in 1998, describes the team’s motivation and process to create a qualitative presence questionnaire. Presence is defined as “the subjective experience of being in one place or environment, even when one is physically situated in another.” Factors involved in level of presence are categorized in four subsets:control (how much control does the user have over the events happening in the environment? How much consistency do they have?),
sensory (richness of information, consistency of information across modalities), distraction (is the user isolated? Are they being attentive? Is the interface distracting?), and realism (fidelity, meaningfulness of experience, disorientation) factors.
The team continued by creating two questionnaires. The first was intended to determine subjects’ natural tendency to be attentive, while the second was intended to measure presence. Certain questions from the second don’t pertain to 360* video; however, many are useful or at least inspirational for a 360-specific presence questionnaire.

### ”When the Elephant Trumps”: A Comparative Study on Spatial Audio for Orientation in 360° Videos (Bala, Masu, Nisi, Nunes)
“The immersive nature of the medium provides the viewer with a degree of agency that helps to engage with the content”. Is this necessarily true? As I see it, looking around within a 360* cinematic scene isn’t agency. That feels like saying that people watching traditional video can move their eyes from one corner of the screen to another. (However, it does potentially lead to interesting engagement with the content.)

Two research questions: how can spatialized music guide viewers’ attention, and how can diegetic cues to guide be reinforced by spatial audio?

“None”, “partial”, and “full” audio tested on different scenes. Partial was created by removing an instrument

Nielsen et al.: explicit vs. implicit cues, cues that limit freedom, diegetic vs. non-diegetic cues

More effective when combined with visual cues

Acousmatic (outside the screen) earcons (auditory icons, sound that describes a notification)

This study had two research questions: How can music be spatialized to guide viewers in 360° videos? and How can the use of diegetic cues be reinforced by the audio spatialization to guide viewers in 360° videos?. “Full” addition of music had some success in directing users’ attention to points of interest within the scene. Visual orientation cues inconsistent with the audio likely interfered with localization. Diegetic cues were perceived as representations of their sources. The paper ends with several concrete suggestions for implementing spatial audio.

### Shot Orientation Controls for Interactive Cinematography with 360 Video (Pavel, Hartmann, Agrawala)
Viewpoint-oriented technique: reorients the shot at every cut

Active reorientation technique lets the user immediately reorient theirselves in “most important” part of scene

Other approaches: Brillhart: orient content across shot boundaries. Align secondary POIs across shots? Slow down video timing? Outside-In: picture-in-picture previews. SwiVR Chair

Development of a new video player software for the study

Specific design implications: viewpoint orientation is good for videos with lots of fast-paced cuts, auto reorientation is good for videos with many points of interest. Simulator sickness effects not described

This study approaches the challenge of guiding viewer attention without restricting agency with the strategy of a video player that automatically re-orients shots. Succeeds in the goal of increasing total time viewers are looking at points of interest, however, the study features no presence questionnaire or discussion of whether the viewers felt that the reorientation limited their ability to explore the scene. https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3126636

### Guidance in Cinematic Virtual Reality-Taxonomy, Research Status and Challenges (Rothe, Buschek, Hubmann)
This paper is an excellent resource. It’s not only comprehensive, but very applicable. The authors establish a taxonomy of CVR attention guiding methods in the contexts of traditional cinematography, attention theory, and eye physiology. Techniques are investigated and adapted from fields as diverse as traditional film and 3D architectural modeling. The methods are rated along various scales (for example, diegetic vs. non-diegetic, world-mapped vs. screen-mapped, subtle vs. direct) and suggested for different applications. No method is written off as a poor guiding method, but rather as poor for particular applications.
