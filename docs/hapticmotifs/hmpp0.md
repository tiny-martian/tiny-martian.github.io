# Haptic Motifs: Project Introduction

## Context & Research Question

360-degree video content is captured with cameras that record a circular (or spherical) view, rather than recording content within a frame. When using special viewing headsets and controller devices, the audience are completely surrounded by the visual scene, and are able to look in any direction within it.

360* video provides fascinating opportunities to push the boundaries of cinematic expression. However, as such a new medium, it also presents major unresolved design challenges. The director cannot automatically expect the audience to see and pay attention to particular visual details of the scene, as they would in traditional video. Meanwhile, the audience is unable to meaningfully interact with or explore the scene in the same ways they would in a VR piece. What the 360* video community seeks is a design language leaning into these challenges, rather than treating them as drawbacks. There are many areas of open experimentation, from establishing new directing and cinematography conventions, to developing better methods for viewing and navigating content.

Controllers for 360* video and VR are usually highly ergonomic and minimalistic, taking after video game controller designs. Some allow complex inputs such as gestures, while others only involve basic input such as pushing buttons. What would it look like for a 360* video piece to have a less traditional controller? One that allowed stranger user inputs, such as clapping patterns or shoulder movement, which could be clearly mapped to the world of the story? One that provided rich tactile information about the progression of the plot, or the emotions of characters, that would be otherwise “invisible”? An narratively meaningful controller could lead to far more compelling and enactive 360* video content.

This research project is focused on the following question:

**How can 360 video become more engaging to audiences through the use of nonconventional or alternative controller devices?**

To explore this topic, I plan to design and build a nonconventional controller device for a 360* video piece that allows the user to have dramatically meaningful and engaging interactions with the content.

## Schedule

Over the next year, I will be following an iterative, hands-on design process: researching existing work and design strategies, proposing a controller design and accompanying video piece, and going through several stages of shooting video, building the controller, and user testing both. I hope to attend two conferences and meet with many voices in the IDN and film communities.
