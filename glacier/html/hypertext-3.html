      There's definitely irony in <a href ="hypertext-2.html">waxing</a> eloquent about something so contrived as the grocery store, to mourn in anticipation of the technology that will render it <a href ="hypertext-9.html">obsolete.</a> Iâ€™m assigning myself the nobility of a hunter-gatherer, equating the act of perusing brands of pickles with that of running down an antelope. Would delivery by drone really remove me that much <a href ="hypertext-4.html">further</a> from the source of my food? But I feel like there's still a certain authenticity in going out into the world to get my food, even if that means hauling around a cart of zucchini noodles and chai and standing in lines. <br> It feels <a href ="hypertext-8.html">important.</a>
